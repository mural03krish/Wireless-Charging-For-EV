# Wireless-Charging-For-EV
## INTRODUCTION
In nowadays era, the importance of electrical cars is increasing and is considered to be the maximum suitable opportunity to petroleum vehicles. The use of electric cars enables in 
controlling the pollutants as no gases are released which also makes a better option. Because of excessive efficiency, low noise and zero carbon emission, the demand for electric motors is 
growing. even though there are some elements which impede the commercialization of electric automobiles. these encompass weight, steeply-priced price, huge ability and charging time of 
battery. on this project we are designing a method for wireless charging of electric cars. wi-fi charging makes use of an electromagnetic area to transfer electricity between two objects through 
electromagnetic induction. right here, the strength is dispatched through an inductive coupling to an electrical tool that could then use the energy to charge the batteries or run the device. There are 
special varieties of wireless charging structures- Conductive charging, inductive charging and battery switching. Right here we are using Inductive charging method. on this era, a 20kHz 
frequency is generated into an electromagnetic field via a energy inverter which might be embedded. It is far based totally at the identical precept as that of a transformer. right here we've 
got a transmitter and a receiver. excessive frequency ac cutting-edge is produced which is furnished to transmitter coil. because of this a magnetic area is created which cuts the receiver coil 
and ac output electricity is produced. The ac output electricity produced is rectified to dc and it's miles then fed to the battery through the battery management device. The wireless charging electric 
powered cars are built with an on-board select up tool that lets in it to be powered by means of an underground energy line whilst riding. This additionally permits the automobile to hold four/5 
much less battery capacity or weight.
